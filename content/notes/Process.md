A **process** is an instance of a program; it is the execution of a program with restricted rights. Processes provide the illusion of an infinite number of _machines_. Each program can have zero, one, or more processes executing it. For each instance of a program, there is a process with its own copy of the program in memory.

The operating system keeps track of the processes on the computer using a data structure called the **process control block** (PCB).
